# Fashion Scout AI 
An end-to-end Computer Vision project that classifies fashion items using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.

## Features
- **Architecture**: 2-Layer CNN with Dropout for high accuracy.
- **Data**: FashionMNIST-style data processed from CSV.
- **Persistence**: Pre-trained weights included for instant inference.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run inference using `model.py` and `fashion_scout_v2.pth`.
